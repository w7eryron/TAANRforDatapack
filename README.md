Using this to remember how to work in GIT.
From my Minecraft TAANR mod I plan to build into a datapack:
op sword, so I can one-hit a creeper
op pickaxe, so I can mine quickly
op helmet, so I can breathe undwewater
op boots, so I can swim quickly
easier way to get a shukler box
smoke or bake to turn zombie flesh into leather and into beefsteak
a tp wand, so I can run home quickly, and return
op bow, with flame and very high-power
everything has mending and unbreaking 11
...
all is done, I just need to copy it here
the tp wand stil needs work
